# lowest order bit corresponding to the first logical CPU and the

# present.

# User Consent configuration
#
# Parts of this section are required if enabling the 'consent' resource under

#
# 'template_dir' gives the location of the templates for the HTML forms.
# This directory should contain one subdirectory per language (eg, 'en', 'fr'),
# and each language directory should contain the policy document (named as
# '<version>.html') and a success page (success.html).
#
# 'version' specifies the 'current' version of the policy document. It defines
# the version to be served by the consent resource if there is no 'v'
# parameter.
#
# 'server_notice_content', if enabled, will send a user a "Server Notice"
# asking them to consent to the privacy policy. The 'server_notices' section
# must also be configured for this to work. Notices will *not* be sent to
# guest users unless 'send_server_notice_to_guests' is set to true.
#
# 'block_events_error', if set, will block any attempts to send events
# until the user consents to the privacy policy. The value of the setting is
# used as the text of the error.

#   template_dir: res/templates/privacy

# Server Notices room configuration
#
# Uncomment this section to enable a room which can be used to send notices
# from the server to users. It is a special room which cannot be left; notices
# come from a special "notices" user id.
#
# If you uncomment this section, you *must* define the system_mxid_localpart
# setting, which defines the id of the user which will be used to send the
# notices.
#
# It's also possible to override the room name, the display name of the
# "notices" user, and the avatar for the user.
#
# server_notices:
#   system_mxid_localpart: notices
#   system_mxid_display_name: "Server Notices"
#   system_mxid_avatar_url: "mxc://server.com/oumMVlgDnLYFaPVkExemNVVZ"

#

# The `alias_creation` option controls who's allowed to create aliases
# on this server.
#
# The format of this option is a list of rules that contain globs that
# match against user_id, room_id and the new alias (fully qualified with
# server name). The action in the first rule that matches is taken,
# which can currently either be "allow" or "deny".
#
# Missing user_id/room_id/alias fields default to "*".
#
# If no rules match the request is denied. An empty list means no one
# can create aliases.
#
# Options for the rules include:
#
#   user_id: Matches against the creator of the alias
#   alias: Matches against the alias being created
#   room_id: Matches against the room ID the alias is being pointed at
#   action: Whether to "allow" or "deny" the request if the rule matches
#
# The default is:
#
#alias_creation_rules:
#  - user_id: "*"
#    alias: "*"
#    room_id: "*"
#    action: allow

# The `room_list_publication_rules` option controls who can publish and
# which rooms can be published in the public room list.
#
# The format of this option is the same as that for
# `alias_creation_rules`.
#
# If the room has one or more aliases associated with it, only one of
# the aliases needs to match the alias rule. If there are no aliases
# then only rules with `alias: *` match.
#
# If no rules match the request is denied. An empty list means no one
# can publish rooms.
#
# Options for the rules include:
#
#   user_id: Matches agaisnt the creator of the alias
#   room_id: Matches against the room ID being published
#   alias: Matches against any current local or canonical aliases
#            associated with the room
#   action: Whether to "allow" or "deny" the request if the rule matches
#
# The default is:
#
#room_list_publication_rules:
#  - user_id: "*"
#    alias: "*"
#    room_id: "*"
#    action: allow


# Server admins can define a Python module that implements extra rules for
# allowing or denying incoming events. In order to work, this module needs to
# override the methods defined in synapse/events/third_party_rules.py.
#
# This feature is designed to be used in closed federations only, where each
# participating server enforces the same rules.

## Opentracing ##

# These settings enable opentracing, which implements distributed tracing.
# This allows you to observe the causal chains of events across servers
# including requests, key lookups etc., across any server running
# synapse or any other other services which supports opentracing
# (specifically those implemented with Jaeger).
#

    # tracing is disabled by default. Uncomment the following line to enable it.
